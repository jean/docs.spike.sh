# Create a badge

## How to create and embed a badge?

On your integration or service page, click on **settings > Create badge.** Copy and use the code on any markdown files such as&#x20;

* GitHub &#x20;
* GitLab&#x20;
* Obsidian
* Roam research
* [and others..](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/)

Alternatively, if you would like to just the image in your Google or word docs file then [feel free to download it here](https://cdn.spike.sh/our-badge.svg).

Below is how it looks on GitHub ðŸ‘‡

{% hint style="info" %}
Upon clicking the badge, it will take you to the service or integration page you created this for. You can, however, customise the destination.
{% endhint %}

### Who can access the pages?

By default, only users from your organisation on Spike.sh can access the integration or escalation page.&#x20;
