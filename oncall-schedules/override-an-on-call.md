# Override an on-call

## What is an on-call override?

Overrides give you the ability to plan on-call coverage for the absence of members in the schedule. Have a dentist's appointment or had a rough week and don't wish to be on-call? Creating an override to get a member from your team to cover the schedule instead of editing your entire schedule. 

{% hint style="success" %}
An on-call override does not repeat like your regular schedule. This makes it easier for someone to be on-call temporarily for a specific period of time
{% endhint %}

### Adding an override

To add an override, **visit your on-call schedule &gt; settings &gt; override**

From the above example, Jay will be on-call from 28th April midnight to 30th April midnight. Adding a comment helps give context for the override.

### Deleting an override

You can remove an override using the delete icon from within the schedule. You needn't edit the on-call schedule to delete the override layer.

### How many overrides can we add?

You can choose to add as many overrides as you want. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure to delete the older overrides so as to avoid confusion. If two overrides overlap then the last added will take precedence. 
{% endhint %}

### Editing an on-call schedule

You will not see override layers while editing an on-call schedule. This is by design as overrides don't tend to repeat.
