# Notifications for on-call shifts

We support alerts for on-call start and end across all schedules. It's a great way to stay updated. Available channels for notifications are 

**Personal notifications**
1. Phone calls
2. SMS
3. Whatsapp
4. Telegram
5. Email

**Time-wide alerts**
1. Slack 
2. Microsoft Teams (*coming soon*)

### When your on-call shift starts/ends

You can choose to get alerts over **Phone calls, WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS, and Email** when your shift starts or ends. Visit [On-call notifications in settings](https://app.spike.sh/settings/personal-on-call) and enable alerts separately for Shift start and Shift end. Once saved, you would get notifications for any on-call schedules you are part of.

You can also customise alerts per on-call schedule in the schedule's settings.

### When any member of your team starts/ends on-call shift

You can set up Slack notifications when anyone of your team starts and ends a shift across all on-call schedules. Visit [Slack settings under organisation > alerts](https://app.spike.sh/settings/general/alerts) and set up channels you would like to receive notifications on. Once saved, all members in selected Slack channels will receive updates on shift start and end.
