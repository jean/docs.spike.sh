# Enforce login

For security, as an admin, you can enforce all members to login via Google or SAML SSO (needs pre-configuration). To set up, visit [Settings > Organisation](https://app.spike.sh/settings/general/organisation)

![Enforce login on Spike.sh](../.gitbook/assets/enforce-login.png)

If enabled for Google, users will be asked to connect their Google accounts. For SSO SAML, users will be restricted from accessing the page unless logging in from your identitiy provider. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Based on your preferences, we will automatically adjust the invite sign up page to show only the available option for joining your organisation's account on Spike.sh.
