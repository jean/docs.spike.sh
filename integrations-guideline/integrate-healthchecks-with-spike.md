# Integrate Spike with Healthchecks

## Service and Integration

Make sure you have the service and integration already setup for Healthchecks. Follow the link below on instructions of how to create integration and service

{% content-ref url="create-integration-and-service-on-dashboard.md" %}
[create-integration-and-service-on-dashboard.md](create-integration-and-service-on-dashboard.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Use the webhook on Healthchecks

![Spike.sh on Healthchecks.io](<../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png>)

You can use our native **Spike.sh** integration on [**Healthchecks.io**](https://healthchecks.io)**. **Copy the webhook from above steps after creating an integration. Next, paste it on Healthchecks.io, simple as that. 

{% hint style="success" %}
This integration supports auto resolution.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are using the webhook integration with Healthchecks.io then feel free to create a new integration as mentioned above and **delete the webhook**. The native integration is more robust and is the recommended way. 
{% endhint %}
