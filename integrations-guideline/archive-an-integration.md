# Archive an integration

## How to archive an integration?

You can choose to archive any integration. Visit the integrations page, select an integration and click archive. 

![archive any integration](../.gitbook/assets/archive-integrations-1.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
Once the integration is archived, no new incidents will be created
{% endhint %}

### Is it possible to retain a webhook after archiving?

No. Once you archive any integration (ex: AWS) and then create a new one (ex: AWS) then the webhook will be different than the archived one.

### Does this affect existing incidents?

No. In fact, the existing incidents will prompt you about archived integration to avoid misinformation.

### How to restore an integration?

There is no automated process. If you certain about restoring then talk to us via chat from the dashboard or email us at [support@spike.sh](mailto:support@spike.sh)
