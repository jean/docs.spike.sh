# Run Playbooks Manually

## User Interaction

Users can manually trigger Playbooks directly from the dashboard or any incident detail page. You will find a dedicated "Playbooks" button on each page. When a Playbook is run, a modal will appear to show the progress of each action step by step. 

## Multiple incidents
A Playbook can be executed for either a single incident or multiple incidents at once. This is handy in case you wish the same response actions across different incidents concurrently.

## Permissions
Default settings permit all users to trigger Playbooks, with admin capabilities to adjust access and control execution rights as needed.


## Customization Before Triggering
At present, Playbooks do not offer the option for users to customize actions or settings prior to execution. The steps set within a Playbook proceed as predefined without alterations.

## Notifications and Logging
The manual initiation of a Playbook is logged within Spike.sh for record-keeping; however, no direct notifications are sent out to team members regarding the Playbook run.
