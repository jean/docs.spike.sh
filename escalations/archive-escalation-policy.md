# Archive escalation policy

## How to archive an escalation policy?

You can choose to archive an escalation policy given that the policy is not associated with any existing integration. 

Visit your [escalations page](https://app.spike.sh/escalations) and select a policy. Click on the settings icon and select archive.

### Restrictions on archiving 

If your escalation policy is already in use on other integrations then you won't be able to archive. Edit your integrations to associate with another escalation. 

{% hint style="success" %}
Once the escalation is not in use with any integration, you would be allowed to archive.
{% endhint %}

### Does this affect on-call schedules?

No

### Does this affected existing incidents?

No. In fact, the existing incidents will prompt you about archived policy to avoid misinformation
