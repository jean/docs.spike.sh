**​How do I disconnect Pushover?**

Visit [Settings](https://app.spike.sh/settings) on Spike.sh to disconnect Pushover. Once disconnected, you will not get any push notification from us.

**Can I assign Pushover to Oncall?**

You can but we don't recommend it since every on-call person now and in the future must have Pushover connected to Spike.sh

**Is there a limit to a number of push notifications?**

None.
