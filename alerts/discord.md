## Get Discord notifications from Spike.sh

Our Discord alert channel is incredibly simple yet informative. Once you add Discord alert channel, you will get a neat hello from us. On every new incident, you will get Incident details along with the link to navigate and take action.

## How to setup?

With Discord, you can get alerts on your Discord workspace using the channel webhooks, by setting up and adding Discord to your escalation policy.

**Step 1**

Navigate to any channel's **settings** &gt; **integrations.** Select the webhook integration on the integrations page.
