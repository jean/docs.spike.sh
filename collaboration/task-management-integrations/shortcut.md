### How to setup Shortcut?

To connect [Shortcut](https://shortcut.com), head to [Settings > Organisation](https://app.spike.sh/settings/general/organisation) and find the Task management integrations section. The connect will ask you for your Shortcut API key. Once saved, Spike will validate the token to safely authenticate and create stories.
