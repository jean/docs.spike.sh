# Link uptime to Status Page

### How to setup?

Add or Edit any Uptime and link a Status Page in it's settings. You can link one or more components  of a status page to your uptime. Every time your uptime goes down, the component will see a new incident that changes the component's status from **Operational to Degraded performance**.&#x20;

One uptime can be linked to one status page. However, one status page can be linked to any number of uptimes.
