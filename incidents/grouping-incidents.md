# Grouping incidents

## Group repeated incidents

Spike supports automatic grouping of incidents which will be repeated. It helps give you perspective on how many times has this incident been repeated. Below is an example -

![This "Parallel write .." has been grouped to give you some insights](<../.gitbook/assets/image (14) (1) (1).png>)

### Use cases

Grouping incidents gives your context. It gives you insights of how many times it has repeated along with it's first occurrence and the last occurrence of this incident. This will help you identify if this is an incident that is truly affecting your customers and how many times it has affected in the past too. Given these stats, you should be able to prioritise this incident and work on it.
