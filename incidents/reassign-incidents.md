You can reassign an incident to a team member. Not all incidents will have assignee to it, especially when you have Slack app notifying you on channels.

Once reassigned, the user will get an email notifying them about it. 

### What happens to escalations?

Your escalation policy for the incident _will NOT be affected_. It will continue as is. 

### Where do I reassign incident(s)?

You will see the reassign incident option on every incident table. More particularly it can be found on -

1. Dashboard
2. Incident details page
3. Incidents listed for a service
