# Sharing incidents

### Global settings to allow sharing

To share incidents publicly,  you will first need to allow sharing of incidents for your entire organisation globally. 

Head over to [organisation settings](https://app.spike.sh/settings/organisation) and select your choice to enable or disable your team from sharing incidents publicly.

{% hint style="info" %}
If public incidents are disabled in organisation settings then all public incident links will be private instantly. 
{% endhint %}

### Sharing a single incident

To share an incident, you will need to click on the **Share** button on the right-hand side of the incident details page.

The link for the public page will **not be unique** for each time to decide to share or not. However, the public page link is unique to each incident.

{% hint style="info" %}
You will not see the share button if public incidents are disabled in organisation settings as mentioned in the above section
{% endhint %}
