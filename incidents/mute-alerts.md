# Mute alerts

## Mute alerts

For every **incident** **and it's repeated incidents**, you can choose to mute all alerts for a specific period of time. Following are the time options currently available -&#x20;

1. An hour
2. 10 hours
3. A day
4. A week
5. A month
6. **Forever** - (_note: be careful with this_)

### Use cases

Not all incidents are critical, also, not all incidents need to be worked upon instantly. For all those low handing fruits, you can now mute the alerts and just log these incidents on Spike.&#x20;
