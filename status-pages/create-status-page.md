For each component, add the name and description.&#x20;

You can choose a start date which is the start time from which the historical stats for the component will be shown. &#x20;

Finally, choose the status for the component. At any time, a component can be in the following states - Operational, Degraded performance, Partial outage, Critical outage and Planned maintenance.&#x20;
